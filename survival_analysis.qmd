## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
clinical_data <- read.csv("data/clinical.cart.2025-04-08/clinical.tsv", sep="\t")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
status <- data.frame(
  sample = clinical_data$cases.case_id,
  is_alive = ifelse(clinical_data$demographic.vital_status == "Alive", 1, 0),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

```

```{r}
assignment <- data.frame("sample" = rownames(conc.subtypes$rf.probs),
                    "type" = conc.subtypes$consensusOV.subtypes,
                    "score" = row_max)
assignment$sample <- sub("\\.rna_seq.*", "", rownames(assignment))
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
merged_df <- merge(status, assignment, by = "sample")
```
